* Recursion is a programming concept. Recursion is calling a function on itself.

* A base case is a statement that stops the recursion.

* A recursive case is the statement where the recursion happens.

* A termination condition is the specific statement that will explicitly stop the recursion.

* As a programmer, you must constantly be thinking about how to prepare for any type of situation and ensure that your code can handle it correctly. Ensure that the arguments you use for the recursion will lead to your base case.
